Converts an English phrase to Pig Latin.

From the AP Performance Task written response:
"i.	The purpose of this program is to translate English phrases into Pig Latin. 
The program is intended to only work with the English language, which rarely (if ever) 
includes any letters with accents, and if they do, it is typically acceptable to not write
them. The program does account for punctuation, such as quotation marks and periods, as well as capitalization."
